## Scala | OOPs Concepts

Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in
programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other
part of the code can access this data except that function.

**OOPs Concepts:**

- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Abstract-Classes
- Class and Object
- Constructors
